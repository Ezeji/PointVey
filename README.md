# PointVey 

This is an app still very much under construction. The app already performs traverse computation as one of its packages under the programs menu.
The app is to contain more functionalities such as more packages in the program menu and the overall functionalities of the app.
When the app is set to run, a first form showing the splash screen pops up for some minutes and setting up the second form afterwards giving room for the user to access the program menu,further traverse computation. 
On Clicking the traverse computation option of the program menu, a third form comes up where the user selects a text file by checking the checkbox object. This is for the text file to serve for storage and display of the traverse computation result. Also, in the third form the user provide relevant information such as stations coordinate information, angles at the instrument station and distances for computation of the coordinate of unknown points.
Clicking **Enter** button processes the information inputted by the user at any period. Clicking the **Reset** button resets the form to accommodate for the computation of further unknown points and this procedure continues for as many points as possible. The **Next** button displays the fourth form where the result of a traverse computation is displayed in text format on a text file.
